Blomkamp was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. At the age of sixteen, he met Sharlto Copley, 
who had also attended Redhill High School in Johannesburg. Copley provided Blomkamp with 
the use of computers at his production company for Blomkamp to pursue his passion and talent 
for 3D animation and design. In return, Blomkamp assisted Copley in creating 3D work for 
pitches on various projects.[5] Blomkamp was 18 when he moved to Vancouver with his family, 
where he enrolled at the Vancouver Film School.
